What to do with this directory
***********************************************************************

CROME beta 0.9.9 brings you more usability by utilizing templates to
allow users to quickly start with a known base rom without having to
fiddle around looking for a file.

Basically, if you have a base tune that you use everytime and would
like to have easy access to it, you can do so by creating a copy of it
in the ($CROME)\new directory and renaming it to a .NEW file.  Whenever
you run Crome and select File->New (or press the New ROM button on the
toolbar), all your base tunes are just a click away without the risk of
overwriting it.

A perfect example in how to take advantage of this new feature is to
copy all base Honda ROMs into the ($CROME)\new directory and renaming
them to .NEW files.  Its also good to give them more detailed names so
they are easier to distinguish. For example, you can copy the very
popular P30 dev rom #203 and rename it to

'P30 JDM Civic B16A DOHC VTEC (203).NEW'

and you can do the same with all other ROMs.
